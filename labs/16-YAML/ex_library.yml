          excerpt: |
            If we discover a complete theory, it should in time be 
            understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just 
            a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, 
            and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion 
            of why it is that we and the universe exist.

            Strange loops arise when, by moving upwards (or downwards) 
            through levels of some hierarchical system, 
            we unexpectedly find ourselves right back where we started.
